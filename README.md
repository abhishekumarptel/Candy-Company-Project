# Candy-Company-Project
This project focuses on analyzing business profits for a candy company using Power BI.
I imported candy product data from pgAdmin, cleaned and transformed it in Power BI's Power Query environment.
Using various charts, slicers, and KPIs, I created an interactive dashboard to provide valuable business insights.
The dashboard helps visualize product sales, profitability, and inventory management.
This project demonstrates data extraction, transformation, and dynamic visualization for business decision-making.
